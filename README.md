# Prettier Plugin Bib

A prettier plugin for BibTeX files.

```
pnpm install prettier @jamesgopsill/prettier-plugin-bib
```

The tool should work out of the box using the indentation rules you have configured in prettier. Plenty more testing and options to come.

# Plans

- Add option to used quotes rather than braces.
- Add option to omit/remove keys that some provide but often not get used in a manuscript (e.g., abstract).
